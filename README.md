## Before you start

Be sure to create a backup for your organization. Just in case...

## How to use this plugin

1. Connect to the desired organization and hit the button "Load Access Team Templates" to retrieve all Access Team Templates of your organization.

4. Wait for the process to finish. 
\
Optional: When it's done you can hit "Load Access Teams" again. This should result in an empty "Access Teams" list if no error occured during the updates and "Divergent Only" was selected.

## Options

* You can click the values of the link columns (Name, Id, Regarding Object) to open the records in your default browser.

* Deselect "Divergent Only" to get a list of teams regardless of whether their "AccessRights" mismatch those of the selected Access Team Template.

* You can use the field "FetchXml Filter" to limit the list of teams to be changed.
\
In the following example only those teams are retrieved/updated, where the regarding object is active:

```
<link-entity name="new_samplerecord" from="new_samplerecordid" to="regardingobjectid">
	<filter>
		<condition attribute="statecode" operator="eq" value="0" />
	</filter>
</link-entity>
```
